## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure, separating concerns into different directories:

- `src/admin`: Contains components and routes specific to the admin functionality
- `src/auth`: Includes authentication-related components and routes
- `src/employee`: Contains components and routes specific to the employee functionality
- `src/api`: Includes API configuration and request handling
- `src/store`: Contains Redux store configuration and slices for state management

## Testing

The project includes unit tests written using Jest and React Testing Library. The tests ensure the correctness of individual components and Redux slices. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

The test coverage report is generated in the `coverage` directory.
